**Orar: Ontology Reasoning via Abstraction Refinement**
------------------------------------------------------------
Orar is a scalable ontology reasoner. Its central technique allows for reducing reasoning of an ontology with a large dataset/ABox to reasoning of a smaller (compressed) *abstraction* of this ontology. Currently Orar supports the Description Logic Horn SHOIF and an extension of DL-Lite with disjunctions and nominals.
