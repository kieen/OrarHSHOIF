**Orar: Ontology Reasoning via Abstraction Refinement**
------------------------------------------------------------
Orar is a prototype reasoner for ontology materialization.  Its central technique allows for reducing materialization of an ontology with a large dataset/ABox to materialization of a smaller (compressed) *abstraction* of this ontology.  Currently Orar supports the Description Logic Horn SHOIF, which captures relevant features of RDFS and OWL 2 profiles.
