**Orar: Ontology Reasoning via Abstraction Refinement**
------------------------------------------------------------
Orar is a scalable ontology reasoner. Its central technique allows for reducing reasoning of an ontology with a large dataset/ABox to reasoning of a smaller (compressed) *abstraction* of this ontology. Currently Orar supports the Description Logic Horn SHOIF and an extension of DL-Lite with disjunctions and nominals.  

To run the system, please follow a short tutorial in https://github.com/kieen/OrarHSHOIF/tree/master/tutorial
